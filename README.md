# Pokemon TCG Prize Checking
At the start of a Pokemon TCG match, each player sets aside 6 cards known as prize cards, face down, from the top of their deck. Throughout the match, players have opportunities to look at the remaining cards in their decks, to deduce which 6 cards have been prized. This technique is known as "prize checking".

This game/tool helps players practice "prize checking".
